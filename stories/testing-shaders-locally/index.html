  <h5>Why?</h5>
  <p>
    As usual I was crawling youtube, watching random videos. I came across this video showing how to create shader art.
    And there I found my next thing that I was gonna nerd about, <strong>Shaders</strong>. I went to the website which
    the guy showed in the video, <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com">shadertoy</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was watching all the amazing shader art people had made, trying to understand them. After 2 hours of dedicated and
    focused work, I was finally able to understand that I couldn't make sense of anything. I went on youtube again to
    learn and to understand shaders. I figured out a little bit about shaders, but I was still not able to understand
    what
    they were.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whatever I learned from youtube and other google searches, I want to try out making my own shaders. I wrote some
    basic shaders I saw on youtube and tried to understand them. I was able to understand the basics of shaders, but
    I was not able to make anything.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cut to July 18, 2025, I was at home and wanted to try writing my own shaders again in my free time. But........
    my internet was so bad that I couldn't even open <i>shadertoy</i>.

  <h5>The solution</h5>
  <p>
    The real solution would be to fix my f****ing internet connection. But that wasn't upto me, I was using mobile
    internet and I didn't have wifi at home.
