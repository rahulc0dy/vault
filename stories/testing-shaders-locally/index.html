  <h5>Why?</h5>
  <p>
    As usual I was crawling youtube, watching random videos. I came across this video showing how to create shader art.
    And there I found my next thing that I was gonna nerd about, <strong>Shaders</strong>. I went to the website which
    the guy showed in the video, <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com">shadertoy</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was watching all the amazing shader art people had made, trying to understand them. After 2 hours of dedicated and
    focused work, I was finally able to understand that I couldn't make sense of anything. I went on youtube again to
    learn and to understand shaders. I figured out a little bit about shaders, but I was still not able to understand
    what
    they were.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whatever I learned from youtube and other google searches, I want to try out making my own shaders. I wrote some
    basic shaders I saw on youtube and tried to understand them. I was able to understand the basics of shaders, but
    I was not able to make anything.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cut to July 18, 2025, I was at home and wanted to try writing my own shaders again in my free time. But........
    my internet was so bad that I couldn't even open <i>shadertoy</i>.
  </p>

  <h5>The solution</h5>
  <p>
    The real solution would be to fix my f****ing internet connection. But that wasn't upto me, I was using mobile
    internet and I didn't have wifi at home.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I thought "what if shadertoy was offline?". I tried to run the website locally, but I couldn't. I searched for
    a local version of shadertoy, i.e. something that could display shaders on my local machine. Most of the solutions
    were either too much for what I wanted or didn't work. So I decided to take matters into my own hands.
  </p>
  <img alt="fine I will do it myself" src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/u8YEMwIfJGMAAAAC/thanos.gif" style="width: 100%">
  <p>
    The plan was to make a simple application that would display the shaders on my local machine. A simple
    <code>glfw</code>, <code>glad</code> and <code>imgui</code> application would do just fine.
  </p>

  <h5>Issues I faced</h5>
  <p>
    The first issue was obviously linking the libraries with cmake. I tried to link <code>glfw</code>,
    <code>glad</code> and <code>imgui</code> but the linker errors just fried my brain. Somehow the linking
    problem was solved.
  </p>
  <p>
    I downloaded <code>glad</code> with OpenGL 4.6 and all the extensions. <strong>Yes, all of them</strong>.
    Through exhausting searches on <i>Stack Overflow</i> and <i>Google</i>, finally the shaders were showing up
    on screen. Next step was to make an interface with <code>imgui</code> so that the user can use shader files
    from his local machine. That was not really a problem, I just had to figure out how to do it, and I did.
    I also added a dropdown for the available OpenGl extensions. And a little note for people copy pasting shaders
    from <i>shadertoy</i>.
  </p>

  <h5>Adding on the base</h5>
  <p>
    The shaders were loading correctly but at this point the path to the directory that had the shader files
    was hardcoded into the executable. A native file picker would be appropriate. For this I found a library
    called <code>tinyfiledialogs</code>. Also added some things like a default shader, the option to only load
    fragment shaders and use a default vertex shader.
  </p>

  <h5>Results</h5>
  <p>
    The result was satisfactory for me. The goal never was to make a huge application for making shaders, just
    a place to view shaders locally that was simple and easy. Not sure if there is a better plan for this
    project in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last thing would be to add hot reloading for the shaders. I was thinking of using <code>watchdog</code>
    for this. But I didn't have time to do it. I will edit this story if I do it in the future.
