  <h5>The Spark</h5>
  <p>
    Recently I saw a youtube video by Ed about how ASCII animations work in the ghostty terminal. <a
    href="https://youtu.be/dUV8pobjZII">This is the video</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    He shows how the ghostty webpage has this cool ghost animation with ASCII characters. Though it seems kind of
    simple, but no sooner I found out it very much isn't. I have been fascinated by ASCII art for a long time and I did
    a little side quest of converting images into ASCII art (or so) with rust.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was mainly taken from the rustfully discord server. If you are interested, you can see it <a
    href="https://github.com/rahulc0dy/side-quests/tree/main/image-to-ascii">here.</a> I will be using it later for the
    animation too.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also saw many people use this old school but

  quest</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The next few paragraphs have a lot of yapping about my struggles. If you do not care about my issues and efforts, <a
    href="#main-content">click here to skip to the main part</a>.
  </p>
  <h5>Trying to understand the ASCII</h5>
  <p>
    So, how do the ascii animations work? It is essentially like all other animations with frames which swap in a
    sequence. So technically you can just put a video element in your webpage to get this effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    But that is no fun, is it? Also this works on a website or app but how do you get this in a terminal so that you can
    flex your riced linux with fancy themes.
  </p>
  <h5>Reusing past learnings</h5>
  <p>
    As I mentioned, in the past I have made (or rather copied mostly,) an image to ascii converter with rust. I thought
    I would do the same for the animations. The problem was, the rust image to ascii converter that I had, took colors
    from the image and rendered it in the console with ANSI colors. So, I just figured I wouldn't take the colors this
    time or maybe try the same with ANSI colors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, How do I get the frames for my animation, even if I take out the frames from a simple animation with something
    like ffmpeg, it is certainly not efficient to convert them to ascii one by one. I could use my rust program here,
    but I will have to store the ascii text so that I don't convert the video to frames or frames to ascii every time I
    run it. It will effectively be cached in a <code>.txt</code> file let's say.
  </p>
  <h5>Understanding what was already done</h5>
  <p>
    Let's look back at what the rust implementation of the image to ascii converter did. I was using two crates for this
    program, the <code>image</code> and the <code>clap</code> crates.
  </p>
  <code-block language="toml"><pre><code>
[package]
name = "image-to-ascii"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"

[dependencies]
clap = { version = "4.5.37", features = ["derive"] }
image = "0.25.6"
</code></pre>
  </code-block>
  <p>
    At the top of the program, I had an ASCII lookup table for looking up the correct character based on the density, or
    fill of the required box.
  </p>
  <code-block language="rust">
<pre><code>
const ASCII_LOOKUP: [&str; 16] = [
    " ", // 0000 - Empty space
    "~", // 0001 - Bottom-left corner
    "$", // 0010 - Bottom-right corner
    ">", // 0011 - Bottom edge
    "╶", // 0100 - Top-left corner
    "=", // 0101 - Left edge
    ">", // 0110 - Diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
    "=", // 0111 - Heavy horizontal
    "^", // 1000 - Top-right corner
    "+", // 1001 - Diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)
    "$", // 1010 - Right edge
    "$", // 1011 - Heavy right side
    "~", // 1100 - Top edge
    "*", // 1101 - Heavy intersection
    "@", // 1110 - Heavy bottom
    "#", // 1111 - Full block
];
</code></pre>
  </code-block>
  <p>
    The next step I did was setup command line arguments using clap. These were used to set options for the input and
    output of the program.
  </p>
  <code-block language="rust" languagecode="rust"><pre><code>
  #[derive(Parser)]
  struct Cli {
  #[clap(name = "path")]
  input_path: String,

  #[clap(short, long)]
  gray_scale: bool,

  #[clap(short, long)]
  #[clap(long, default_value = "20")]
  width: u32,

  #[clap(long, default_value = "20")]
  height: u32,

  #[clap(short, long)]
  output: Option&lt;String&gt;,

  #[clap(
    long,
    help = "The program will save the image produced for the asciifying to a file"
  )]
  save_intermediate: Option&lt;String&gt;,

  #[clap(short, long)]
  fattness: Option&lt;f32&gt;
</code></pre>
  </code-block>
  <p>
    I resized the image to the width and height as passed through the CLI. The image crate retrieved the x, y and
    rgba values of each pixel of the image. I set the transparent pixels as a whitespace " " to keep the
    transparency of png images. The rest of the code was just looking up the correct character from the lookup
    table created earlier and setting appropriate colors for the characters from these obtained values.
  </p>
  <h5>Getting frames for the animations</h5>
  <p>
    The first thing needed for the animation are the frames that we will animate eventually. Download any small
    and simple animation or video you like. The more contrast it has between the background and the subject, the
    better the translation into ASCII.
  </p>
  <p>
    ffmpeg is a great tool to use now. We retrieve the frames from the video just downloaded with the following
    command <code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 frame_%04d.jpg</code> . This command extracts all the frames from the video.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the video is a five-second video shot at 25 frames per second (fps). This means each second of the video
    has 25 frames. Running the above command for this video will generate 125 frames (5 x 25 = 125 frames). And if
    you were to run it for a 60-second video shot at 30 frames per second, you would get 1800 images (60 x 30 =
    1800 frames).
  </p>
  <h5>Generating ASCII maps for the frames</h5>
  <p>
    We already have the program to convert images to ASCII maps. We can make a simple modification to run the
    program with a loop on all the frame(images).
