  For the past 5 years, I have been working with next js, and honestly I love it and it's been great. Whenever I wanted
  to spin up a new web project, I couldn't think of anything except [Next.js](http://nextjs.org/). But since moving up
  to semester 6 of my CSE degree, I was forced to go back to writing website with vanilla web technologies, and heck
  even php which I honestly don't like.

  But working with plain js and css, it's rewired my brain into thinking natively what the browser does. I did make a
  portfolio website in framer, but I wanted to have a blog or more of a showcase of my work and maybe remaking my
  portfolio. Recently I saw the news about gsap going free for everyone after the webflow acquisition. I was also really
  impressed by [this guy](https://github.com/Kalabasa) with this [sick website](https://leanrada.com/) with his blogs
  and arts [and what not](https://github.com/Kalabasa/leanrada.com). All of this combined made me think "heck, let's go
  back to the roots". I wanted to utilise html css and plain js (and also gsap) to make interactive elements in my blogs
  to make things interesting and understandable rather than being a plain old text article.

  Working with plain old HTML, CSS and JavaScript I came into some rather anticipated issues. I wanted all of my blogs
  to be separate html and CSS and with interactive elements. So I needed some kind of templating. I was attracted to
  hono for it's built in capability to work with jsx. I wasn't sure if I want to work with hono, or any server for that
  matter. It isn't something that would need server specifically.

  Now, templates or htmx was not an option for me as I didn't want any extra unnecessary dependencies for this website.
  So I settled for the web components api which allows native custom html elements in browsers. I took info from the
  repo I mentioned before which did it in the same way with custom html elements for the headers, footers etc. It was a
  rather tedious job to set up all the custom tags, css and animations for these elements primarily because I had no
  idea that this existed.
