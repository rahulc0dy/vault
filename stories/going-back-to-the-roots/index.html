  <h5>Motivation</h5>
  <p>
    For the past 5 years, I have been working with next js, and honestly I love it and it's been great. Whenever I
    wanted to spin up a new web project, I couldn't think of anything except <a href="http://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    But since moving up to semester 6 of my CSE degree, I was forced to go back to writing website with
    vanilla web technologies, and heck even php which I honestly don't like.
  </p>
  <p>
    But working with plain js and css, it's rewired my brain into thinking natively what the browser does. I did make a
    portfolio website in framer, but I wanted to have a blog or more of a showcase of my work and maybe remaking my
    portfolio. Recently I saw the news about gsap going free for everyone after the webflow acquisition.
  </p>
  <h5>Inspiration</h5>
  <p>
    I was also really impressed by <a href="https://github.com/Kalabasa">this guy</a> with this <a
    href="https://leanrada.com/">sick website</a> with his blogs and arts
    <a href="https://github.com/Kalabasa/leanrada.com">and what not</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of this combined made me think "heck, let's go back to the roots". I wanted to utilise html css and plain js
    (and also gsap) to make interactive elements in my blogs to make things interesting and understandable rather
    than being a plain old text article.
  </p>
  <h5>Issues I faced</h5>
  <p>
    Working with plain old HTML, CSS and JavaScript I came into some rather anticipated issues. I wanted all of my blogs
    to be separate html and CSS and with interactive elements. So I needed some kind of templating. I was attracted to
    hono for it's built in capability to work with jsx. I wasn't sure if I want to work with hono, or any server for
    that matter. It isn't something that would need server specifically.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, templates or htmx was not an option for me as I didn't want any extra unnecessary dependencies for this
    website. So I settled for the web components api which allows native custom html elements in browsers.
  </p>
  <p>
    I took info from the repo I mentioned before which did it in the same way with custom html elements for the headers,
    footers etc. It was a rather tedious job to set up all the custom tags, css and animations for these elements
    primarily because I had no idea that this existed.
  </p>
  <h5>Result</h5>
  <p>
    So, finally I have this site now, this is not complete and definitely not optimized, the homepage is laggy for less
    powerful systems and the image loading is slow. I need to put in some research and work to fix these issues. But all
    in all this was an amazing experience.
