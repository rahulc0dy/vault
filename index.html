      Even though I am a web developer and designer, I want to get into game development. I'm currently exploring the
      world of game
      creation, aiming to craft simple yet elegant experiences. I have always loved the retro 8 bit pixelated theme of
      games and especially platformers.
      I am very determined to learn game development in C++ but I keep facing problems that are not even related to my
      goal, starting from weird linking errors to random memory leaks.
      It is fun most of the time, I like solving these problems but it becomes exhausting some times. And yes, I could
      use a game engine like unity, but I want to learn the basics of rendering and OpenGL at the least. I hope I can
      put enough time into this to learn something new.
